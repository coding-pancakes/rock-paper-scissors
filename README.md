# Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, Scissors ✂️

## This is my first Python project!

This game is set up to be played in a best of 3 loop. To play again, clear the terminal and rerun the code.

This mini game was made using loops, if/else, and the random.randint() function.

I formatted the if/else by mapping out each combination before writing it up.
